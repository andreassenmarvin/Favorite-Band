            About the band.
        </h1>

<p> 
    Motionless in White is an American heavy metal band from Scranton, Pennsylvania. 
    Formed in 2005, the band consists of Chris "Motionless" Cerulli (lead vocals), Ryan Sitkowski (lead guitar), 
    Ricky "Horror" Olson (rhythm guitar), Vinny Mauro (drums), and Justin Morrow (bass). The band has stated that their band name derived from the Eighteen Visions song "Motionless and White".
  
Motionless in White was signed to Fearless Records for their first three studio albums; their fourth album, Graveyard Shift, was released on May 5, 2017, via Roadrunner Records.
Their most recent fifth album, Disguise, was released on June 7, 2019.

<p>
The band is described by AllMusic as a blend of metalcore, gothic metal and industrial metal. The group's song structure commonly features intricate riffs coupled with occasional blast beats during verses and breakdowns present in songs. 
The keyboard effects are also noted, having been claimed to add a "dark and uneasy atmosphere" to the group's music on their debut album Creatures.

<p>
Motionless In White has unique lyrics as well as an outstanding vocalist,Chris "Motionless".That's why I consider it to be my Favorite band.
