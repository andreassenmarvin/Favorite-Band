The band is described by AllMusic as a blend of metalcore, gothic metal and industrial metal. The group's song structure commonly features intricate riffs coupled with occasional blast beats during verses and breakdowns present in songs. 
The keyboard effects are also noted, having been claimed to add a "dark and uneasy atmosphere" to the group's music on their debut album Creatures.

<p>
Motionless In White has unique lyrics as well as an outstanding vocalist,Chris "Motionless".That's why I consider it to be my Favorite band.
